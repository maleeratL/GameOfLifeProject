//Class DisplayIsland
- doing as a main class to build objects in the island
- method draw island and display island, animals and food inside
- 

//Class Things
- as a super class of animals and plants 
- method to display information
- method to create random position
- create constructor that get data for both animals and plants class as a initial information

//Class Island 
- create constructor to allow users to initial size of island in the main class(DisplayIsland)
- have an ArrayList to store animals and plants in the list
- method to add animals and plants in island
- method to print animals and plants (while check position of animals and plants)
- method to print water animals (while check position of water animals)
- method to draw area of land on island (in the space that is not the same position)
- method to draw area of water on island
- method to generate island by automatically display island 10 times
- method to check that the position of animals and plants will be outside island or not by return boolean
- method move random position while check that the random position is still in the island(animals and plants)
- method to generate round of growing plants will be different
- method to increment growing by showing number(Max grow is 9)
- method to decrement growing by showing number if it decrease until 0 and it will be eaten it will be remove
- method to check out of the island if the next position x or y of animals is out of the island will set back the the previous position and random move again
- method to check each turn of display island if it reach certain number of turn and animals did not reach food it will be remove
- method to random position water by using random position by calculate with width and height of the water whether is out of the island or not
- method run though all animals that is survive on the list(not be remove or has create as a new object)

//Class Animals extends Things
- create constructor from parent class(Things)
- method to move in 4 directions: left, right, up, down
- method to random move whether left, right, up, down
- method check collision move in the same position
- method to check distance by return boolean and pass direction to move in move method
- method to check the closet food (Meat or Plants) that animals can eat and move toward that direction
- method to move to food if check distance is true
- method to remove
- method to check if animals side by side to each other will create the new animals objects
